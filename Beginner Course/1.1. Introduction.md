---

### Front-End Development
This focuses on the user-facing side of applications, dealing with what users see and interact with.

#### Core Skills:
1. **HTML/CSS**:
   - **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Structures the content on the web.

   - Frameworks/Libraries: React, Angular, Vue.js for building complex UIs.

3. **UI/UX Design Basics**:
   - Understanding of user interface (UI) design and user experience (UX) principles.
   - Tools: Figma, Adobe XD.

4. **Version Control**:
   - Proficiency in Git and GitHub for managing front-end code.

### Back-End Development
This involves the server-side logic and database management that powers the front-end.

#### Core Skills:
1. **Programming Languages**:
   - Common choices: Python, Java, JavaScript (Node.js), Ruby, PHP, or C#.

2. **Frameworks**:
   - Help streamline server-side development.
   - Examples: Express.js (Node.js), Django (Python), Spring Boot (Java), ASP.NET (C#).

2. **Containerization**:
   - Tools: Docker, Kubernetes for deploying and managing applications in containers.

3. **CI/CD**:
   - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions.

4. **Monitoring**:

### Soft Skills
1. **Problem-Solving**:
   - Ability to debug and resolve issues across the stack.

2. **Collaboration**:
   - Working with designers, other developers, and stakeholders.

3. **Adaptability**:
   - Quickly learning new technologies or tools as needed.

---

### Typical Workflow
1. Gather and analyze requirements.
2. Design the application architecture.
3. Develop the front-end and back-end modules.
4. Connect the front-end with the back-end via APIs.
5. Test and debug the application.
6. Deploy the application to production and monitor its performance.
